## ðŸš€ Quick Start
Should co-locate as much as possible and not use the global directories unless necessary.

### Examples of colocating files
- schema.ts - For defining the types and schemas used like zod schemas
- hooks.ts - For defining the hooks used like useQuery, useMutation, etc
- use-something-hook.ts - For file specific hooks as an alternative to hooks.ts
- graphql.ts - For defining the GraphQL queries and mutations used in the page
- components.ts - For defining the components used in the page
- custom-components.ts - For file specific components as an alternative to components.ts
